# IN5270

## Project1 : Finite difference simulation of 2D waves

### Overview of files

In this directory you encounter three files.

* main.py
* wave_2D.py
* Project1 IN5270.ipynb

The Jupyter-notebook file contains a report summarizing the work done and the main results of the project. All the code produced is also available in the notebook, so strictly speaking the two python files in this directory are redundant. They are included for readability and reproducibility purposes.

The wave_2d.py file contains the implemented class solver and the main.py file is used to test the implemented solver for different types of 2D waves.

### Reproducing results

If you want to reproduce results for any of the tasks in the project, simply write in your terminal

```console
python3 main.py tasknumber
```

where tasknumber is either 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4 depending on which type of wave you wish to produce plots for.
